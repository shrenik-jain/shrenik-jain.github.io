          ‚ÄúYou have to believe in yourself!‚Äù is what I heard from my father as I was 
          heading for my first big audition. I had a number pinned to myself so that 
          the judges could call out ‚Äúnumber 23, next, number 31, thank you, you‚Äôre done‚Äù 
          instead of calling out our names. I was already very nervous and never wanted 
          to come here and the judges calling out our assigned numbers was only making 
          it worse. As soon as self-belief came into the equation, amid practical 
          reminders to look the judges in the eye, not fidget, and not look down, 
          my stomach dropped. If this was a game of believing in myself, I had already 
          lost.
      </p>
      <img class="center" src="assets/img/blog/self-doubt.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        Believing in myself always felt like one more thing I could fail at. 
        Through my teen, I have always been hearing pep talks from my friends and 
        family, who reminded me that the first step towards doing anything is 
        ‚Äúbelieving I can do it.‚Äù It has seemed to pop up in phrases everywhere, 
        be it Instagram posts or Pinterest motivational boards. It was like the 
        most popular person at the party, who made me think that the only thing 
        between me and my dreams was self-confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-doubt is usually considered as a monster, something which I need to 
        get rid of as soon as possible. But the further I paddle through life and 
        think more about it, it might be that very monster that helps me to keep 
        going. As much as self-belief helps us get through the hurdles in life, 
        self-doubt has the power too ‚Äì to help us move from one chapter to the 
        other with self-awareness. If self-doubt is not accurate, then it is 
        detrimental but at the same time, if you‚Äôre not experiencing any doubts, 
        you probably aren‚Äôt doing much to push yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unpleasant truth is that, had I waited for self-confidence to kick in, 
        I wouldn‚Äôt have done anything. I would be waiting and uncertain about colleges 
        not fit for me; shy first messages which would turn into unforgettable 
        friendships; moving to cities where I knew no one, but wanted everything. 
        With doubt, I need no guarantees that success would come looking for me. 
        To me, self-confidence meant being sure, and me, I was never sure. I just 
        wanted to try.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doubt has made me brave. It has made me believe that either I could do things 
        despite doubting myself, or I could not do them at all ‚Äì because the confidence 
        I‚Äôd been told I needed was not coming or has yet to come. Ours is a society 
        overflowing with confidence and even then we require constant reminders about 
        our limitless capacity and that we can do anything, if and only if we believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I look at myself and instead of seeing a little boy who didn‚Äôt know 
        how to believe in himself, I see a young man, who doubts but decides to step 
        forward anyway. And that approach I think is something worth believing in.

        <b>Are you really mean, or is it just the world around you that thinks you are?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúMean‚Äù is definitely an interesting label to identify someone. Without 
        giving it a second thought, how quickly do we label a person as mean? But have 
        we ever thought that this label can imply almost anything? Surely some people 
        totally deserve this title, owing to their actions and behavior towards 
        everyone. They can be seen constantly bullying and teasing their friends and 
        everyone around them. Their actions are solely channeled in their own interest, 
        no matter the repercussions. They repeatedly lie, cheat and steal 
        (not just physically). These are the ones who genuinely deserve this intricate 
        label.
      </p>
      <img class="center" src="assets/img/blog/confident-man.jpg" alt="confident man">
      <p>
          But then there is the other category of mean people. These are the ones who 
          have been carved and sculpted the way they are by the genuine cruelty of this 
          world. The ones who stop letting anyone and everyone take advantage of them. 
          Those who envy small talks. The ones who actually say what they‚Äôre thinking, 
          maybe with a mild filter. The ones who appreciate justice and hold others 
          accountable. Do you really think they deserve to be labeled ‚Äúmean‚Äù? 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also amusing how some of us cater to words like nice and mean. Their 
        definitions often resemble the skin and not the substance lying within. 
        People think being nice to you entitles them to your soul, your patience, 
        your forgiveness, your second and third chances, even if they don‚Äôt deserve 
        any of that. And if you fail to provide them with any of those things, guess 
        who turns out to be the ‚Äúmean‚Äù and ‚Äúegoistic‚Äù one? Ironic, I must say!
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing that keeps hammering my head is that you‚Äôre called cynical and 
        pessimistic for your candor, usually by the ones who always claim to be happy 
        and positive. But if they are actually so happy, you wonder why are they so 
        agitated by you and your thoughts. What I believe is that the people who like 
        and admire you will never have a problem with your personality. They will 
        never fail to support you to become a better version of yourself and at the 
        same time call you out when you make mistakes. You can always count on them 
        for staying by your side through thick and thin. So what about those who 
        don‚Äôt? Well, they will call you mean, selfish and all sorts of names. 
        They will talk behind your back, trying to undermine your reputation and 
        take away your dignity. Shoot. Let them. The ones who know you in and out, 
        won‚Äôt ever have second thoughts about the kind of person you are.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I mean to say is that someone out there will always dislike you no 
        matter what you do. Of course, you can‚Äôt make everyone happy, you‚Äôre not 
        pizzaüòÜ. So even if you are a little mean, don‚Äôt worry. Somewhere or the 
        other all of us are! I think it is a proviso for the kind of person you‚Äôre
         meant (or should I say ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù) to be. After all, not everyone thinks 
         you‚Äôre mean, just the predators. The ones who wanted to prey on your grace, 
         who thought you were going to let them get away with all kinds of crap. 
         Notice their disappointment when you deny them these perks and remember to 
         pity them, but only a small amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now back to square one, I just want you to ask yourself this one question, 
        are you really mean, or is it just the world around you that thinks you are?
      </p>
