            <p>Reasonable Self Doubt</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="work-section-content">
          <p>
            “You have to believe in yourself!” is what I heard from my father as I was 
            heading for my first big audition. I had a number pinned to myself so that 
            the judges could call out “number 23, next, number 31, thank you, you’re done” 
            instead of calling out our names. I was already very nervous and never wanted 
            to come here and the judges calling out our assigned numbers was only making 
            it worse. As soon as self-belief came into the equation, amid practical 
            reminders to look the judges in the eye, not fidget, and not look down, 
            my stomach dropped. If this was a game of believing in myself, I had already 
            lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Believing in myself always felt like one more thing I could fail at. 
            Through my teen, I have always been hearing pep talks from my friends and 
            family, who reminded me that the first step towards doing anything is 
            “believing I can do it.” It has seemed to pop up in phrases everywhere, 
            be it Instagram posts or Pinterest motivational boards. It was like the 
            most popular person at the party, who made me think that the only thing 
            between me and my dreams was self-confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-doubt is usually considered as a monster, something which I need to 
            get rid of as soon as possible. But the further I paddle through life and 
            think more about it, it might be that very monster that helps me to keep 
            going. As much as self-belief helps us get through the hurdles in life, 
            self-doubt has the power too – to help us move from one chapter to the 
            other with self-awareness. If self-doubt is not accurate, then it is 
            detrimental but at the same time, if you’re not experiencing any doubts, 
            you probably aren’t doing much to push yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The unpleasant truth is that, had I waited for self-confidence to kick in, 
            I wouldn’t have done anything. I would be waiting and uncertain about colleges 
            not fit for me; shy first messages which would turn into unforgettable 
            friendships; moving to cities where I knew no one, but wanted everything. 
            With doubt, I need no guarantees that success would come looking for me. 
            To me, self-confidence meant being sure, and me, I was never sure. I just 
            wanted to try.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doubt has made me brave. It has made me believe that either I could do things 
            despite doubting myself, or I could not do them at all – because the confidence 
            I’d been told I needed was not coming or has yet to come. Ours is a society 
            overflowing with confidence and even then we require constant reminders about 
            our limitless capacity and that we can do anything, if and only if we believe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today I look at myself and instead of seeing a little boy who didn’t know 
            how to believe in himself, I see a young man, who doubts but decides to step 
            forward anyway. And that approach I think is something worth believing in.

            <p>Crafting a Strong Personality</p>

        <div class="work-section-content">
          <p>
            <b>Are you really mean, or is it just the world around you that thinks you are?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mean” is definitely an interesting label to identify someone. Without 
            giving it a second thought, how quickly do we label a person as mean? But have 
            we ever thought that this label can imply almost anything? Surely some people 
            totally deserve this title, owing to their actions and behavior towards 
            everyone. They can be seen constantly bullying and teasing their friends and 
            everyone around them. Their actions are solely channeled in their own interest, 
            no matter the repercussions. They repeatedly lie, cheat and steal 
            (not just physically). These are the ones who genuinely deserve this intricate 
            label.
          </p>
          <p>
              But then there is the other category of mean people. These are the ones who 
              have been carved and sculpted the way they are by the genuine cruelty of this 
              world. The ones who stop letting anyone and everyone take advantage of them. 
              Those who envy small talks. The ones who actually say what they’re thinking, 
              maybe with a mild filter. The ones who appreciate justice and hold others 
              accountable. Do you really think they deserve to be labeled “mean”? 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also amusing how some of us cater to words like nice and mean. Their 
            definitions often resemble the skin and not the substance lying within. 
            People think being nice to you entitles them to your soul, your patience, 
            your forgiveness, your second and third chances, even if they don’t deserve 
            any of that. And if you fail to provide them with any of those things, guess 
            who turns out to be the “mean” and “egoistic” one? Ironic, I must say!
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing that keeps hammering my head is that you’re called cynical and 
            pessimistic for your candor, usually by the ones who always claim to be happy 
            and positive. But if they are actually so happy, you wonder why are they so 
            agitated by you and your thoughts. What I believe is that the people who like 
            and admire you will never have a problem with your personality. They will 
            never fail to support you to become a better version of yourself and at the 
            same time call you out when you make mistakes. You can always count on them 
            for staying by your side through thick and thin. So what about those who 
            don’t? Well, they will call you mean, selfish and all sorts of names. 
            They will talk behind your back, trying to undermine your reputation and 
            take away your dignity. Shoot. Let them. The ones who know you in and out, 
            won’t ever have second thoughts about the kind of person you are.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I mean to say is that someone out there will always dislike you no 
            matter what you do. Of course, you can’t make everyone happy, you’re not 
            pizza😆. So even if you are a little mean, don’t worry. Somewhere or the 
            other all of us are! I think it is a proviso for the kind of person you’re
            meant (or should I say “supposed”) to be. After all, not everyone thinks 
            you’re mean, just the predators. The ones who wanted to prey on your grace, 
            who thought you were going to let them get away with all kinds of crap. 
            Notice their disappointment when you deny them these perks and remember to 
            pity them, but only a small amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now back to square one, I just want you to ask yourself this one question, 
            are you really mean, or is it just the world around you that thinks you are?
          </p>
